    Hello! My name is Paige C. and I'm an artist based in Perth, Western Australia. My art usually looks like installation and sculpture,
    and my focus is ready-made domestic ephemera. My favourite tool is the needle-nosed plier! I'm currently working on completing my PHD overseas 
    in sunny West Virginia, USA, through Curtin University.
