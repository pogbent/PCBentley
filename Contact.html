            Feel free to get into contact about any works/questions that
            you have in the field below and I will get back to you as soon
            as I can!

            Unfortunately since taking on the workload of a PHD and moving overseas
            , my response time is going to be a little delayed. Thank you for your patience!

            <span>UPDATE:</span> The area I'm researching has restrictions on wifi/cell reception
            and so I cannot guarantee a reply. If you need to get in contact urgently,
            please get in touch with Dr. Myers (jonathan.myers@staff.curtin.edu.au) and
            I will do my best to respond.
        </p>
