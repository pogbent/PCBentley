    Got back from the Brandywine house tonight (no accomodation that close to the observatory) and 
    wow! Looking at this picture doesn't do it justice - the dish is gigantic! The house (that little lump on the left) is so so close (I think
    the property is one of the only ones bordering the observatory). I got to take a brief walk through but it's 
    a long ways from town and I left pretty late. I'll post the pictures tomorrow hopefully.

    On my way to a house that Samuel (the kinda-cool-kinda-racist guy that saved me
    when my car broke down) mentioned was empty a ways out of town. It's apparently pretty 
    close to the Sugar Grove observatory, so I wont be able to get reception until I get back.
    I'm excited to see the dish! I can see it off in the distance all the time but it's one thing
    to conceptualise it, and a whole other thing to actually stand under it. I can't imagine what 
    the peope living there would have thought about it. Wary? Safe? Observed? Some of the people I 
    met in town moved here /to be in/ the NRQZ because they thought it would be healthier/safer for them
    (there is a belief that EMF's and radio signals can cause some health problems apparently, so 
    living here eliminates that), but to be so close to the dish would be a totally different experience.

    Car breaking down in a foreign country at night: horrifying. Car 
    breaking down in front of a confederates house: also horrifying. Being 
    let into said confederates house and being eagerly shown around after
    expressing an interest in vintage/collectors items and American homes: somehow
    actually OK. Samuel and Tina were the lovely couple that found me on the road near
    their house broken down and kindly (very, very kindly) let me hang out with them
    until I (samuel) fixed the tire. You'd think with so many projects to do with cars/ 
    car repair tools I could do it myself, but apparently I was 'shaking like a newborn deer'
    so I let the professional handle it. In turn they showed me around their house (which they've
    owned for 40 years now!) and all the attachments that come with it. I felt bad taking any 
    obvious pictures but I snagged this one of their patio/porch. That silver packet is an army
    ration!

    Sorry for the radio silence (hah!), but I finally made it to Brandywine, WV!
    Guide said this would be one of the last sunny days for a while so we made the most
    of it and went for a drive. There are so many beautiful old houses out here,
    some of them empty! I hope. Can't do any trespassing (don't tell Jon) but I get my own
    hire car tomorrow so I can go trawling for one that's properly abandonded. Fingers crossed
    for some stuff left behind!!

    Phew!! Absolutely stoked to announce that "How to Change a Car Tyre" is currently being
    exhibited at the Mulligan Gallery from the 13th of November to the 7th of January. It would mean 
    a lot to me if you could come down and see the work - we got a whole car into the gallery space!!
    Big thanks to Ben for technical help, Mum and Dad for putting up with having a car skeleton in their
    driveway for a year, Kevin for moral support and for Pheobe for taking all the pics! Couldn't have done it without everyone's help!

        Something I forgot to post before: the massive lighter collection (which is technically only about half of what they originally 
        had!) at the house in Spearwood. It's so interesting that lighters (ones that stayed on the table instead of in back pockets) were
        so commonplace and on display that they became decorative objects. Notable examples: lighter which is also a tiny slide viewer
        in the shape of a TV, a fairly nondescript lighter except for the fact that it has a calendar and a pewter lion lounding on it, one in 
        the shape of a genie's lamp, and a cigarette dispenser in the shape of a donkey (who dispenses cigarettes out of its ass).

        Another beautiful cabinet arrangement in Spearwood. The people who own it used to collect 
        antiques but stopped a few years ago, and this equates to what they wanted to keep from their pretty sizable 
        collection. The cream of the crop! What's also cool is that you can see what's in vogue for collecting/what's 
        part of a set that would be of the same era: two jade dishes, two horse sculptures, two similarly framed paintints. 
        The clock is apparently one of three left from a collection of about 30. These things were EVERYWHERE in their prime.

        Long time no post! Was visiting a garage sale when I got talking to the owner (Kath), 
        and she ended up showing me inside. This cabinet has been in her family for the last 40 years, but 
        the contents are even older. For a long time her mother used to fastidiously clean all the 
        dishware inside (a sign of a good household amongst neighbours I'm sure) but now exactly 
        what's inside is a little mysterious. Beyond what's immediately visible, Kath said she couldn't say 
        what's in there. She has plans on organising it and passing it down to grandkids if she gets the chance, or, if not, 
        giving it away. "As long as it goes somewhere" she said.

    Sharing some notes from a really fantastic article I read recently by 
    Hal Foster (mainly because some people have been asking me what the difference is between
    my work and the stuff you find in museums >:[ there aren't many! the artist 
    functions as the curator) The gist of it is that artworks like mine which feature ready-made 
    objects and which are produced as an archive aren't archival because they draw upon
    existing archives, but because they are arranged according to 'archival logic'. <br>
    To put the arguement to bed, the 'differences' between art-as-archive and the archives of
    museums is love! The models of thinking (which inform how the objects are arranged) and the 
    'lessons' that the work provides values love as much as knowledge. <br>
    (the article is "An Archival Impulse" (2004) by Hal Foster)

    Doing some large scale floorplan stuff this afternoon which, despite how I look, I'm actually pretty excited for. If you're out 
    and about today head down to the honours studios (212:109) and I can show you the ropes! Well - the tape.

    More houseplans but this time a little bigger. I feel like a zoo animal getting enrichment so I don't go crazy - especially when

    Something I've been playing around with: randomly generated houseplans! Basically I give someone
     (the less informed the better) and asking them to direct my hand as I draw, offering instructions
      like 'two up', 'seven down' going along the grid. Surprisingly, most of the shapes end up closed.
      Afterwards, we go back over in pen to turn it into a house plan. It's really interesting to see
      how the rooms fit into the closed shape, what hallways form, what areas are focussed on - I think there's 
      a little bit of 'house' in every shape!

    Big fan of this copy of the Pied Piper I found where the owner jammed his name
    on the front cover? in big bold marker pen? and like its on the inside cover as well 
    (in 10000px font) so I'm not sure what he expected to happen to the book where it would 
    require a label claiming ownership on BOTH sides. But anyway. On one hand: hi, Wyatt!
    On the other hand, this is a really cool look into this person's actions - the size of 
    the text, the medium, the lack of care for the book (in the sense that he wrote all over it), and 
    the fact that it's this book in particular. After Steve's shed I've been enjoying doing some 
    detective work on men's domestic possessions.

    Some more pictures from the shed: well-worn tools! I haven't spoken much to 
    Alex's granddad, but it's so interesting to see what you can discern from this arrangement: 
    Steve does lots of gardening/landscaping, but not everyday maintenance - there's a focus 
    on wholesale physical alterations going on (shovel, axe, pickaxe). I can only assume
    the horseshoe is there for sentimental reasons, but it's curious that it doesn't have a hook/ 
    hanging attachment.

    Got to take a tour of Alex's granddad's shed today. What I found most interesting is 
    the method of organisation/categorisation of tools. All the wrenchs/screwdrivers are together
    but they're not sorted by size (or type), and everything seems to be almost non-hierarchal. 
    A stanley knife hooked atop a wrench. Scissors next to a square edge. So much character in 
    a single pegboard.
